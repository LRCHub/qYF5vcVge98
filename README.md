[00:28.35] Gather round! Gather round!
[00:29.94] I have a story to share
[00:31.51] About a demon
[00:33.14] Who rewrote
[00:34.26] The narrative
[00:40.76] 
[00:36.35] There was a dirty rat
[00:37.46] Heading up to bat
[00:38.60] And you took your swing
[00:39.56] Baby, that's on that
[00:40.60] Don't try to change the story
[00:41.69] 'Cause things got gory
[00:42.76] A monster who fucks up people's life when they get bored, see?
[01:13.76] 
[00:45.48] Cause Nothing fazes you
[00:46.27] Nothing changes you
[00:47.32] The only thing on your mind is when everyone praises you
[00:49.42] It's always about you
[00:50.77] The universe surrounds you
[00:51.86] But guess what, baby
[00:52.84] We're gonna thrive without you!
[01:08.34] 
[00:53.96] It's so damn funny (ha, ha, ha)
[00:55.81] It's so damn funny (ha, ha, ha)
[00:58.06] This is so damn funny
[01:00.68] (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha)
[01:16.68] 
[01:02.76] Think I should mention
[01:03.85] Got a brand new obsession
[01:06.43] Starts with realising the damage that you've done
[01:09.64] I'm not one to play nice
[01:12.30] Yeah, you shoulda thought twice
[01:13.38] Before every promise became a lie!
[01:15.74] Say it again! Say it again!
[01:17.89] It's funny what an angel you think you've been
[01:40.89] 
[02:12.53] (Haven't you heard? It's breaking news!)
[02:14.98] (All of the crying lies tied your best friend's noose)
[02:16.51] (Haven't you heard? It's your own abuse)
[02:18.67] (You pried with your lies)
[02:19.75] (Yet you still demand proof)
[02:21.06] (Haven't you heard? It's breaking news!)
[02:23.32] (All of the crying lies tied your best friend's noose)
[02:25.85] (Haven't you heard? It's breaking news!)
[02:29.93] Haven't you heard? It's breaking news!
[02:32.32] All of the crying lies tied your best friend's noose
[02:34.44] Haven't you heard? It's your own abuse!
[02:36.50] You pried with your own eyes
[02:37.81] Yet you still demand proof
[02:38.61] Haven't you heard?
[02:40.52] It's breaking news!
[02:42.33] You gaslit until all hell broke loose
[02:43.19] You claimed it was us
[02:44.88] That you're innocent!
[02:45.57] Well, watch your back cause karma can be a bitch!
[03:10.07] 
[02:49.05] Think I should mention
[02:51.10] Got a brand new obsession
[02:53.33] Starts with realizing
[02:55.44] The damage that you've done
[02:57.56] I'm not one to play nice
[02:58.89] Yeah, you shoulda thought twice!
[03:00.28] Before every promise became a lie
[03:02.00] Say it again! Say it again!
[03:04.69] It's funny what an angel you think you've been
[03:07.36] Haven't you heard? It's breaking news!
[03:09.24] All of the crying lies tied your best friend's noose
[03:11.39] Haven't you heard? It's your own abuse
